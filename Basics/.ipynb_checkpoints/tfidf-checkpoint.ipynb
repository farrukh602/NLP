    "###  Introduction\n",
    "TF IDF is a popular technique in natural language processing which measures the importance of a term in a document relative to whole corpus. By this technique, words with in a document are transformed in to importance numbers by a text vectorization process. \n",
    "Main Idea: Vectorize/score a word by multiplying the word's Term Frequency (TF) with Inverse Document Frequency(IDF):\n",
    "Related Formulae:\n",
    " 1. TF = f_term/ n_terms\n",
    "     f_term = number/frequency of the term to appear in a particular document\n",
    "     n_terms = total number of terms in that document\n",
    " 2. IDF\n",
    "    IDF of a term reflects the proportion of documents in the corpus that contain the term. It is a way of weighting more the unique/less freqeunt terms in the corpus and weighting less to frequently occuring words like is, and, the etc.\n",
    "    IDF = log(Number of documents in the corpus/ Number of documents in the corpus containg a particular term)\n",
