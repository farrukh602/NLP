# NLP Data Vault

Welcome to the NLP Data Vault! This repository is your centralized storage space for datasets, corpora, and other valuable data assets relevant to your Natural Language Processing (NLP) endeavors.

## About

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. As you delve deeper into the world of NLP, you'll accumulate a variety of datasets that are crucial for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Features

- **Datasets**: Store diverse datasets for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, summarization, and more.
- **Corpora**: Curate corpora collections for linguistic analysis, language modeling, and other research purposes.
- **Annotations**: Include annotated datasets with labels, annotations, or ground truth for supervised learning tasks.
- **Resources**: Keep track of relevant resources, papers, articles, books, and other materials associated with the datasets and NLP topics.
